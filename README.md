# scrapy-and-serp

## A simple system that obtains links from serp api and scrapes the links using scrapy

## Run main.py
- Running this file first gets the url(s) from serp api and scrapes these urls saving scraped headings and paragraphs in markdown files inside text_output folder.
- Queries can be added in run_spiders() method in main.py

*Update the method add_vector_db to let RaptorPack ingest scraped data.*
